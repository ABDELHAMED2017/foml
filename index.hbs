        <h1>About This Course</h1>

        <div class="module">
            <p>This course covers a wide variety of topics in machine learning and statistical modeling. While mathematical methods and theoretical aspects will be covered, the primary goal is to provide students with the tools and principles needed to solve the data science problems found in practice.  This course also serves as a foundation on which more specialized courses and further independent study can build.</p>

            <p>The course schedule can be found <a href="docs/ML_101_Schedule.xlsx">here</a>. </p>

            <!--         <p>We will use <a href="https://piazza.com/">Piazza</a> for class discussion. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, please <a href="https://piazza.com/nyu/spring2017/dsga1003/home">post your questions on Piazza</a>, where they will be answered by the instructor, TAs, graders, and other students.  For questions that are not specific to the class, you are also encouraged to post to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> for programming questions and <a href="http://stats.stackexchange.com/">Cross Validated</a> for statistics and machine learning questions.  Please also post a link to these postings in Piazza, so others in the class can answer the questions and benefit from the answers.

            <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solid mathematical background</strong>, equivalent to a 1-semester undergraduate course in each of the following: linear algebra, multivariate calculus (primarily differential calculus), probability theory, and statistics. The content of NYU's <a href="http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/pages/DSGA1002_fall15/index.html"><strong>DS-GA-1002: Statistical and Mathematical Methods</strong></a> would be more than sufficient, for example.</li>
                <li><strong>Python programming required</strong> for most homework assignments.</li>
                <li><em>Recommended:</em> Computer science background up to a "data structures and algorithms" course</li>
                <li><em>Recommended:</em> At least one advanced, proof-based mathematics course</li>
            </ul>

                    <dd>This is a practical guide to machine learning that corresponds fairly well with the content and level of our course.  While most of our homework is about coding ML from scratch with numpy, this book makes heavy use of scikit-learn and TensorFlow. We'll use the first two chapters of this book in the first two weeks of the course, when we cover "black-box machine learning."  It'll also be a handy reference for your projects and beyond this course, when you'll want to make use of existing ML packages, rather than rolling your own.</dd>

                    Elements of Statistical Learning</cite> (Hastie, Friedman, and Tibshirani)</a>
                    <dd>This will be our main textbook for L1 and L2 regularization, trees, bagging, random forests, and boosting.  It's written by three statisticians who invented many of the techniques discussed. There's an easier version of this book that covers many of the same topics, described below. (Available for free as a PDF.)</dd>
                </dt>

                <dt><a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/"><cite>An Introduction to Statistical Learning</cite> (James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani)</a>
                    <dd>This book is written by two of the same authors as The Elements of Statistical Learning. It's much less intense mathematically, and it's good for a lighter introduction to the topics. Uses R as the language of instruction.  (Available for free as a PDF.)</dd>
                </dt>

    	          <dt><a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/"><cite>Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms</cite> (Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David)</a>
    	              <dd>This is our primary reference for kernel methods and multiclass classification, and possibly more towards the end of the course.  Covers a lot of theory that we don't go into, but it would be a good supplemental resource for a more theoretical course, such as Mohri's <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/ml16/">Foundations of Machine Learning</a> course. (Available for free as a PDF.)</dd>

    	              <dd>Our primary reference for probabilistic methods, including bayesian regression, latent variable models, and the EM algorithm.  It's highly recommended, but unfortunately not free online.</dd>
                </dt>

    	          <dt><a href="http://www.data-science-for-biz.com/DSB/Home.html"><cite>Data Science for Business</cite> (Provost and Fawcett)</a>
    	              <dd>Ideally, this would be everybody's first book on machine learning.  The intended audience is both the ML practitioner and the ML product manager.  It's full of important core concepts and practical wisdom.  The math is so minimal that it's perfect for reading on your phone, and I encourage you to read it in parallel to doing this class.  Have your managers read it too.</dd>
